# Titanic Data Analysis

Taking into consideration a sample of 891 of the 2224 passengers of the Titanic, I used Python, Jupyter notebook and pandas to get some statistics about the passengers and survival rates according to different factors.

I did this project as part of the Intro to Data Analysis course, from the Data Analyst Nanodegree I took at Udacity
